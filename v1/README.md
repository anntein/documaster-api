# Introduction

We recommend starting with the [Examples](examples.md) to get a quick grasp of what the Documaster API is capable of.

Your mastery of the API can then be further expanded by getting acquainted with the entirety of the [Data model](model.md) and available [Endpoints](endpoints.md).

Do read through the [Access control](access-control.md) in order to gain an understanding of the behavior of our access control.

# Authentication

In order to utilize the APIs you need to authenticate. The steps for doing so will depend on whether Documaster is set up with the [Documaster Identity Provider](https://github.com/documaster/idp-web-services#resource-owner-password-credentials-flow) or [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth-ropc)

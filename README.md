# Introduction

This repository documents all supported versions of the publicly-exposed Documaster Integration API.

The master branch contains documentation that has been peer-reviewed and released. Backwards-incompatible changes to the documentation merged in master is not expected unless the documentation itself is found to be incorrect.

The develop branch, on the other hand, contains documentation about services that have not yet been released and are subject to change.
